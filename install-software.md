# Install software

At EDA you'll be using specific tools every day: a terminal (AKA: command line), a text editor (the application you will use to write your code) and Git (which you'll install in week 1). You'll also need a web browser of course, and for consistency we suggest you use Google Chrome. We'll be installing the following:

1. __A command Line Tool:__ iTerm2 (Mac) or Windows Terminal (Windows)
2. __A code/text editor:__ Visual Studio Code


__Note about Visual Studio Code:__ Visual Studio Code, or VS for short, is a text editor. Developers write code locally their computer via a text editor before pushing it up onto the web. Other popular text editors include Sublime and Atom.
There is nothing "magical" about these text editors. You could (if wanted to have a really frustrating time) write all of your code in a text editor like Microsoft Word or Notepad. Computer code is really just text! However, text editors like Visual Studio are _designed for writing code_, and come with tools to make the process much easier. 

Please do not use Microsoft Word for programming.

## OS X (Mac) instructions

__Command Line Tool: *iTerm*__   
Mac's come with an inbuilt command line called 'terminal', however iTerm2 is our terminal of choice.

1. Download and install [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)
2. Unzip, and drag the app into your applications folder

## Windows instructions
__**IMPORTANT:**__ You must be running Windows 10. If you don't have access to Windows 10 please get in touch with one of the Dev Academy staff and we can provide guidance around this.

The Windows development environment can be a little tricky to set up correctly, mostly because of the lack of a good terminal. One option is to "dual-boot" Linux; a way of installing a development setup without sacrificing your current operating system. There are some good guides available to set this up. However it's probably not something you want to try first if you're just starting out and not feeling very confident.
