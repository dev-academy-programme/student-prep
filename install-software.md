# Install software

At EDA you'll be using specific tools every day: a terminal (AKA: command line), a text editor (the application you will use to write your code) and Git (which you'll install in week 1). You'll also need a web browser of course, and for consistency we suggest you use Google Chrome. We'll be installing the following:

1. __A command Line Tool:__ iTerm2 (Mac) or Git Bash (Windows)
2. __A code/text editor:__ Visual Studio Code


__Note about Visual Studio Code:__ Visual Studio Code, or VS for short, is a text editor. Developers write code locally their computer via a text editor before pushing it up onto the web. Other popular text editors include Sublime and Atom.
There is nothing "magical" about these text editors. You could (if wanted to have a really frustrating time) write all of your code in a text editor like Microsoft Word or Notepad. Computer code is really just text! However, text editors like Visual Studio are _designed for writing code_, and come with tools to make the process much easier. 

Please do not use Microsoft Word for programming.

## OS X (Mac)

__Command Line Tool: *iTerm*__   
Mac's come with an inbuilt command line called 'terminal', however iTerm2 is our terminal of choice.

1. Download and install [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)
2. Unzip, and drag the app into your applications folder


__Text Editor: *VS Code*__   
1. Download and install the current stable release of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for Mac

## Windows instructions
The Windows development environment can be a little tricky to set up correctly, mostly because of the lack of a good terminal. One option is to "dual-boot" Linux; a way of installing a development setup without sacrificing your current operating system. There are some good guides available to set this up. However it's probably not something you want to try first if you're just starting out and not feeling very confident.

__Command Line Tool: *Git Bash for Windows*__   
Git Bash a similar way of working to the Mac and Linux terminals, and will allow you to follow most of Foundations without installing other software.

1. Go to [Git Bash for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)
2. Follow the download and install instructions


__Text Editor: *VS Code*__   
1. Download and install the current stable release of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for Windows
2. Unzip and install it in your programs directory

## Linux instructions (Ubuntu)

__Command Line Tool: *GNOME*__   
Already installed with Ubuntu!

1. Open up GNOME Terminal
2. Have a looksie


__Text Editor: *VS Code*__   
1. Download and install the current stable release of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for Linux
2. Unzip and install
