_Credit: [Joris Toonders, Entreprenuer](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140402151626-7386607-4-questions-you-should-ask-yourself-every-day?trk=tod-home-art-list-large_0)_

Many people just start the day by following their to-do list and checking their e-mail. [Josh] learned that the most effective way to coach yourself is to ask yourself 4 powerful questions every day. Ask yourself 2 questions at the beginning of the day and 2 questions at the end of the day. It makes sure you're much more focused on things that really matter and makes every day more fun.

Take 15 minutes to ask yourself 4 questions and write down the answers. It's the most powerful way to train your brain. It gives you a better understanding on what things you need to improve and gives a better feeling because you're working towards your long term goals.

___The 2 questions to ask yourself at the beginning of every day:___

__1. What are my goals today?__
Most people have goals in the mid and long term (e.g. Learn web development), but don't translate them to the short term. If you want learn to be employed as a web developer in 6 months time, what are you doing today to reach that goal?

An example goal might be "Complete JavaScript blog challenge" or "Spend 4 hours coding"

Ask yourself every day: What are my goals today?

__2. What are my challenges today?__
Successful people set themselves challenges every day. It's a way of living. You have to challenge yourself every day, to get the most out of you and become better, faster and smarter. It will make life much more interesting. Set yourself challenges and enjoy the journey.

Ask yourself every day: What are my challenges today?

___The 2 questions to ask yourself at the end of every day:___

__1. Have I reached my goals for today?__
Setting yourself goals at the beginning of each day isn't enough. You have to evaluate yourself. Make sure you don't get lost in excuses, by telling yourself that you weren't able to reach your goals today. The goals you've set by yourself in the morning, were the goals you wanted to reach. Have you succeed?

If yes, take a moment to enjoy the fact that you reached it and ask yourself what you've done good today to reach your goals. If not, ask yourself what you can do better the next day to make sure you reach your goals. If you fail to reach your daily goals day by day, try different ways of working to improve it. Don't give up. If you reach your daily goals day by day, try giving yourself more ambitious goals and look what's happening.

Ask yourself every day: Have I reached my goals for today?

__2. What have I learned today?__
Take a moment every day, to ask yourself what you've learned today. It can be everything, as small or as big as you want. If you don't learn enough, take a critical look at the goals and challenges you set every day. If you learn a lot, life will be much more fun.

Ask yourself every day: What have I learned today?


## Create your Plan
1. Using the knowledge you have, design a plan for your Foundations work. Write your plan in your learning journal.
2. Use a calendar to block out your time. Know when you are going to study and when you are going to relax.

## Reflect
In your journal ask yourself what you have learned today. Why is it important? Relevant?
